Tab Bar

 * [x] Required: Configure the titles and icons of the tab bar items.

Scrollable views
 * [x] Required: Each view controller should have an image view for the custom navigation bar and a scroll view that contains an image view for the content of the tab. Hide the navigation bar of each navigation controller.
 * [x] Required: Since you have to set the content size of the scroll view in code, you have to create a custom view controller for each screen (e.g., FeedViewController, MessagesViewController, etc)
 * [x] Required: For the FeedViewController, add an additional image view that contains the compose buttons for status, photos, and check ins.

Story Detail View
 * [x] Required: Add a invisible button to the Thrillist post that takes you to a detail page.

Posting
 * [x] Required: Tapping the Status, Photo, or Check In buttons from the feed page should modally present the respective compose view controllers.
 * [x] Required: Tapping cancel on each view controller should dismiss the view controller. Since this has to be done in code, you'll need custom view controllers for each compose screen.

Bonus
 * [x] Optional: In the story detail view, tapping in the text field should bring up the keyboard and animate the text field above the keyboard.


 
Notes:
I left colored backgrounds in view controllers because that was one of the milestones. If I removed them later, you would not know if I had done it.
